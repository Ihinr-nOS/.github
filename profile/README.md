**IhinrẹnOS** (*"Progress" in Edo*) is Africa’s first open-source operating system built **by Africans, for Africans** for IoT Embedded, Computing and Mobile market, combining cutting-edge performance with cultural intentionality.  

## 🚀 Purpose  
To empower Africa’s digital sovereignty by:  
- 🛡️ Reducing dependency on foreign tech stacks.  
- 🌾 Addressing local challenges (agriculture, healthcare, education).  
- 🌐 Optimizing for Africa’s unique infrastructure (low-bandwidth, multilingual, IoT-first).  

## 🔧 Core Components  
- **PureHarmony**: Derived from PureHarmony OS project, based on Oniro and ancestral OpenHarmony roots.
